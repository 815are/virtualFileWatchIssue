# MemFS

- install this extension
- Run extension
- Open any folder in opened extension window
- add zip file from `temp/testProject.zip`.
- run command `watcherTest: Register global watcher` to register global watchers to monitor `**/*.js` file changes.
- Extract `temp/testProject.zip` in opened extension window by running command `unzip estProject.zip`.
- Change js file from extracted sources -> `testProject\ext\test.js`

Problem, watcher is not triggered in BAS.
